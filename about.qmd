## As a driven Biology student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, I am preparing for a medical career with a solid commitment to public health and community empowerment. This fall, I am embarking on a new journey, initiating a mixed-methods research project on HPV studies through the School of Public Health. I aim to leverage this research to further understand and address public health challenges.
